# Welcome to myvu

myvu is social movie ranking app for film and list enthusiasts/nerds like myself who want to keep track of the films, good or bad, that they've seen. 

At its core, myvu allows you to search for movies, give them a score and add them to your ranked list or collection. The app will render basic movies details and images and store all of your saved movies and lists in your personal account.

The endgame is slightly more comprehensive and lucrative (and a bit of a secret for now) but will involve a social aspect, connecting users with similar tastes. 

## What's the inspiration? 

Largely a result of evolution. 20 years ago I started logging films in an Excel spreadsheet. 10 years later Google sheets made it all the more prettier and accessible. Now, it needs a new home that can provide it with a bit more love.

Letterboxd is awesome, and very close to what I have in mind. Its older and less decorated (and very dead) sibling, Flickchart, is probably more on the mark. But at the end of the day, it's its own thing. 

## What will I be using to build this?

**Fixed** / *Subject to change* 

* **Time that I don't have**

* *Jest with RTL*
* **Storybook**
* **Framer-motion**
* **Vercel**

amongst others...

## Why? Who cares? 

Great question! I have no idea. But if I can find one other person that finds it useful, that's a win for me.
